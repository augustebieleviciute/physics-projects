# Physics Projects

Projects from my BSc Physics degree Computational Physics courses

## How big can a Neutron star be?
  Investigation of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff formula and the polytropic star model. This project includes extensive use of arrays, functions, NumPy and Matplotlib libraries and ODE integration.
  
## Elastic neutron scattering and its dependance on temperature

 Investigation of the dielectric material with change of temperature. Intensities of elastic scattering neutrons were given at varying temperatures. This project includes arrays, functions, NumPy, Matplotlib and SciPy libraries, curve fitting of data points.
 
## Weather analysis

 Data manipulation, file cleanup and basic analysis is the main point of this project. This project uses IO commands, arrays and their manipulations, functions, Matplotlib and NumPy libraries, classes and testing of functions.
